# Instructions

{% include time-estimate.html %}

By the time you get here you should have:

* Successfully installed and tested **GitHub Desktop** on your computer.
* Made a *fork* of the **Prototype 2 Debugging Challenge** repository to your GitHub account. Choose the appropriate repository for your block:
  - **1st Block:** [Prototype-2-Debugging-Challenge-S2A1](https://github.com/SKHS-GDP2-S2A1-2019-2020/Prototype-2-Debugging-Challenge-S2A1)
  - **7th Block:** [Prototype-2-Debugging-Challenge-S2B7](https://github.com/SKHS-GDP2-S2B7-2019-2020/Prototype-2-Debugging-Challenge-S2B7)
* *Cloned* the repository to your Desktop.
* Opened the **Prototype 2** debugging challenge in Unity on your computer.
* Set the external script editor in Unity's preferences (Edit > Preferences) to **Visual Studio Code**.

With that accomplished, we're going to spend a few minutes tuning the complete version of Prototype 3 to make it more playable. Then we are going to track down bugs in the game, document them using GitHub Issues, and work on fixing them.
